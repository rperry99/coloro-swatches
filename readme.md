# Coloro X WGSN Color OF The Year

I recently found out about the [Coloro X WGSN Color of The Year](https://coloro.com/key-colors#KeyColors-A/W-26/27). I thought I would make a little swatch thing inspired by their swatch page.

This is mostly just for some front end practice for myself. I, nor this project is affiliated with either Coloro or WGSN. This is purely a for-fun project for myself.
